I'm not trying to suggest doing harm nor do I believe all harm is equal.<br>
It's just that I could not break this rule, no matter how hard I tried.

Despite this, I still want to pursue a resolution where no one is harmed.<br>
Because some types of harm could be easily avoided if the people involved just take a bit of time to learn, to understand.

I probably would never fulfill a promise to contribute to a project (not showing the name here but it's easy to check).

> Not being able to understand how to do one thing **is** not being able to understand how to do it.

I made the promise because I was confident in my ability to learn things.
I was too confident.
I shouldn't have expected myself to be able to understand how to contribute to it back then.

More on this in a later blogpost. Will update.
